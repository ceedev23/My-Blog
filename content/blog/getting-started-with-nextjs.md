# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a powerful framework for building React applications. It provides a great developer experience with features like:

- Server-side rendering
- Static site generation
- API routes
- File-based routing
- Built-in CSS support

## Why Next.js?

Next.js makes it easy to build production-ready React applications. It handles many of the complex configurations that you would otherwise need to set up manually.

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js project, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-blog
```

This will create a new Next.js project with all the necessary dependencies and configurations.

## Key Features

1. **File-based Routing**: Create pages by adding files to the `pages` directory
2. **API Routes**: Build API endpoints by adding files to the `pages/api` directory
3. **Static Site Generation**: Generate static pages at build time
4. **Server-side Rendering**: Render pages on the server for better performance

## Conclusion

Next.js is an excellent choice for building modern web applications. Its features and developer experience make it a joy to work with.
